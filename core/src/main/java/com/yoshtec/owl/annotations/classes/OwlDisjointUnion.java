 * TODO: how use this in java?

 * <blockquote>
 * A disjoint union axiom DisjointClasses( C CE1 ... CEn ) states that a class C is a disjoint union of the class expressions CEi, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, all of which are mutually disjoint with each other. Such axioms are sometimes referred to as covering axioms, as they state that the extensions of all CEi exactly cover the extension of C. Thus, each instance of C must be an instance of exactly one CEi, and each instance of CEi must be an instance of C. Each such axiom is a syntactic shortcut for the following two axioms:
 * <br>
 * <code>
 * EquivalentClasses( C UnionOf( CE1 ... CEn ) )
 * DisjointClasses( CE1 ... CEn )
 * </code>
